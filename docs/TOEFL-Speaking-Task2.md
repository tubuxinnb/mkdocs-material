# Speaking Task 2

## Reading Material

1. Definition (Priority 1)
2. Funcion (Priority 2)
3. Orders of Events (If time allows)

For Example: 

**Relict Behaviors**

Typically, animals behave in certain ways to ensure that they survive in their natural habitats. But there are instances in which an animal species might exhibit a behavior **that doesn't seem to have an obvious use anymore (function here, other supplement is unnecessary)**, in fact, it probably hasn't fulfilled its original purpose for a very long time, maybe even thousands of years. **Such** behaviors, called **relict behaviors**, were beneficial to the animals when the habitat they lived in was different; however, now, because the habitat has changed, that behavior no longer fulfills its original function. Long after the environmental situation that shaped its evolution has disappeared, the behavior remains, like a relic, a remnant, left from long, long ago.

Def: the behavior which has no obvious use.

Fun: It is shaped long time ago, now the habitat has changed, the behavior no longer fulfills its original funcitons.
